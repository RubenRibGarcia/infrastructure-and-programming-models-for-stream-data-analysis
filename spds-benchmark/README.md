# IMPADS - SPDS Benchmark

IMPADS (Infraestruturas e Modelos de Programação para Análise de Dados em Stream) is an thesis theme which the main objective is to evaluate, test and benchmark various Streaming Processing Data Systems.

Some SPDS that have significant popularities are:

* [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) | [Github](https://github.com/apache/flink)
* [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/) | [Github](https://github.com/apache/storm)
* [Apache Kafka (With Kafka Stream API)](https://kafka.apache.org/) | [Github](https://github.com/apache/kafka)
* [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org/) | [Github](https://github.com/apache/samza)
* [Apache Heron (Incubator)](http://heron.incubator.apache.org/) | [Github](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron)


For the limitation of time base on thesis delivery, the main SPDS that will be approached are Apache Storm, Apache Flink and Apache Kafka (Kafka Stream API).

The main objective of this projects are:
* Evaluate the infrastructure needed
* Evaluate the programming model
* Evaluate the deployment process for infrastructure
* Evaluate development process of an topology
* Benchmark built topology for each SPDS
