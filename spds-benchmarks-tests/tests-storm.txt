Case Tests:
N | Type | Parallelism | Phase | Max sustainable throughput

1 | C5a.2xlarge | 8 parallelism | Output | 4000 events/s
(
    Notes:
        - the Max Sustainable throughput for this case test could be much higher then
)

2 | C5a.2xlarge | 16 parallelism | Output | 8000 events/s (speculation)

4 | C5a.2xlarge | 32 parallelism | Output | 16000 events/s (speculation)
