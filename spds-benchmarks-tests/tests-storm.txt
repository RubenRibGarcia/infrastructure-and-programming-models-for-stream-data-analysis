Case Tests:
N | Type | Parallelism | Phase | Max sustainable throughput (events/s)

1 | C5a.2xlarge | 8 parallelism | Output | 4000
(
    Notes:
        - the Max Sustainable throughput for this case test could be much higher then
)

2 | C5a.2xlarge | 16 parallelism | Output | 8000 (speculation)

4 | C5a.2xlarge | 32 parallelism | Output | 16000 (speculation)
